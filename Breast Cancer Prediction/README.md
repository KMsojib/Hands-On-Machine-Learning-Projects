# ðŸ©º Medical Diagnosis ML â€” Breast Cancer Prediction

## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on **Breast Cancer Prediction**. The objective is to develop and evaluate models that classify tumors as benign or malignant based on key clinical features.

The workflow includes:
- **Data Exploration (EDA):** Understand feature distributions and correlations.
- **Model Training & Comparison:** Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree models.
- **Explainability (XAI):** Interpret predictions using SHAP and LIME.
- **Reporting:** Generate performance metrics and visual figures for model evaluation.
